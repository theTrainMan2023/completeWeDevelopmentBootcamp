                My skill, expertise, knowledge and love for equality and liberty gives me the appetite and drive to make a success of every task and achieving my overall objective and that is to play my small part in the bigger picture.

                I completed a part-time course in Public Management and Governance, and have achieved an 83% final pass rate on this course. I believe I found a passion in this field of study and would like to pursue this with a National Diploma and still later a degree. Please do not let my lack of post matric education negatively impact your decision not to give me the opportunity to nurture and grow a career path that I wish to follow.
