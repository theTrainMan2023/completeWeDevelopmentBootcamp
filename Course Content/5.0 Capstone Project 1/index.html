    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I consider myself to be a highly motivated and skilled individual, always open to implementing new and fresh views with a passion for learning. I am fully computer literate, am able to multi task and is outcomes based orientated. I have extensive knowledge as an administrator in logistics, performance management and office administration. I do possess effective communication skills. A healthy team player as well as fully capable of working as an individual due to having self-discipline and my insatiable drive to succeed. </p>

    <p>My skill, expertise, knowledge and love for equality and liberty gives me the appetite and drive to make a success of every task and achieving my overall objective and that is to play my small part in the bigger picture. Dedication, drive and tenacity give me the simple edge to learn new roles and transform into an asset that will uphold the pillars and principles of this great organisation.</p>

    <p>I completed a part-time course in Public Management and Governance, and have achieved an 83% final pass rate on this course. I believe I found a passion in this field of study and would like to pursue this with a National Diploma and still later a degree. Please do not let my lack of post matric education negatively impact your decision not to give me the opportunity to nurture and grow a career path that I wish to follow.</p>
